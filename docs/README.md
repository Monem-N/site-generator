# Website Generator System Architecture

## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Website Generator system architecture, detailing the six core components and how they interact to transform documentation into fully functional websites with automated testing.

## Core Components

The Website Generator system consists of six core components:

1. [WebsiteGenerator](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) - The central orchestrator that manages the entire generation process
2. [DocumentationParser](./DOCUMENTATION_PARSER.md) - Parses documentation from various formats into a standardized content model
3. [ComponentGenerator](./COMPONENT_GENERATOR.md) - Transforms parsed content into React components based on templates and design system
4. [TestGenerator](./TEST_GENERATOR.md) - Generates automated tests for components based on their type and functionality
5. [Builder](./BUILDER.md) - Compiles and optimizes the generated components into a production-ready website
6. [Plugin System](./PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md) - Provides extension points throughout the generation pipeline for customization

## 5-Step Pipeline Process

The Website Generator follows a 5-step pipeline process:

1. **Parse Documentation Sources** - Transform documentation files into a standardized content model
2. **Generate React Components** - Create React components from the parsed content
3. **Apply Design System** - Apply styling and design system components to the generated components
4. **Generate Tests** - Create automated tests for the components
5. **Build and Optimize** - Compile and optimize the components into a production-ready website

## System Architecture Diagram

The components interact in a sequential pipeline, with the Plugin System providing hooks at various stages:

```
Documentation Sources → DocumentationParser → ComponentGenerator → TestGenerator → Builder → Generated Website
                                ↑                    ↑                 ↑              ↑
                                |                    |                 |              |
                                +--------------------+------ Plugin System ---------+
```

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed information about each component, please refer to the individual documentation files:

- [System Architecture Overview](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Documentation Parser](./DOCUMENTATION_PARSER.md)
- [Component Generator](./COMPONENT_GENERATOR.md)
- [Test Generator](./TEST_GENERATOR.md)
- [Builder](./BUILDER.md)
- [Plugin System](./PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md)

## Configuration

The Website Generator is highly configurable through a comprehensive configuration object (`WebsiteGeneratorConfig`) that includes settings for all aspects of the generation process. For more information, see the [System Architecture](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration) documentation.

## Extension Points

The system provides several extension points for customization:

1. **Custom Parsers** - Register parsers for additional formats
2. **Component Templates** - Create templates for specific content types
3. **Design System Integration** - Configure and extend the design system
4. **Plugins** - Create plugins with hooks at various stages of the pipeline
5. **CMS Integration** - Connect to various CMS platforms

For more information, see the [System Architecture](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md#extension-points) documentation.
