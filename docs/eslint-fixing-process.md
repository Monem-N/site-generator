# ESLint Fixing Process

This document outlines the process for fixing the 19,035 ESLint issues in the codebase.

## Overview of Issues

The main categories of issues are:

1. **Prettier formatting issues** (8,178 errors)
2. **Type safety issues**:
   - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` (187 errors)
   - `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` (85 errors)
3. **Module system issues**:
   - `@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires` (119 errors)
4. **Logic and runtime errors**:
   - `no-fallthrough` (69 errors)
   - `no-console` (64 errors)
   - `no-sparse-arrays` (23 errors)
   - `no-redeclare` (18 errors)

## Phased Approach

We've created a phased approach to tackle these issues:

### Phase 1: Automatic Fixes

Run the following scripts to automatically fix formatting and other auto-fixable issues:

```bash
./scripts/fix-prettier.sh
./scripts/fix-eslint-auto.sh
```

### Phase 2: Type Safety Improvements

Run the following script to identify files with type safety issues:

```bash
node ./scripts/fix-type-safety.js
```

Then, manually fix the identified issues by:
1. Replacing `any` types with more specific types
2. Removing unused variables or prefixing them with underscore

### Phase 3: Module System Improvements

Run the following script to identify files with module system issues:

```bash
node ./scripts/fix-module-system.js
```

Then, manually fix the identified issues by:
1. Replacing `require()` with import statements
2. For dynamic requires, using dynamic imports or adding ESLint disable comments

### Phase 4: Logic and Runtime Errors

Run the following script to identify files with logic and runtime errors:

```bash
node ./scripts/fix-logic-errors.js
```

Then, manually fix the identified issues by:
1. Adding break statements or `// fallthrough` comments in switch cases
2. Replacing `console.log` with a logger or removing debugging statements
3. Fixing array declarations with empty slots
4. Renaming variables or using let/const instead of var

## Running All Scripts

You can run all scripts in sequence with:

```bash
./scripts/fix-all-eslint.sh
```

## Commit Strategy

After fixing issues, commit changes in logical groups:

1. Formatting fixes
2. Type safety improvements
3. Module system improvements
4. Logic and runtime error fixes

This will make the changes easier to review and understand.

## Ongoing Maintenance

To prevent these issues from recurring:

1. Configure your IDE to run ESLint and Prettier on save
2. Add pre-commit hooks to run ESLint and Prettier
3. Add ESLint and Prettier to your CI/CD pipeline
4. Regularly run the fix scripts to catch new issues
