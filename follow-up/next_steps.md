# Next Steps for Docsify Site Generator

Based on the current status of the project, here are the recommended next steps organized by priority and timeline:

## Immediate Priorities (1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Fix Remaining TypeScript Configuration Issues

- **Standardize Type Definitions**:

  - Move all type definitions to a single location (preferably the root `/types` directory)
  - Update import paths throughout the codebase
  - Create a clear structure for types organization

- **Resolve tsconfig.json Issues**:

  - Update `rootDir` configuration to properly handle types outside src/
  - Set `"target": "es2015"` or higher to support iteration over Maps and Sets
  - Add `"downlevelIteration": true` if targeting lower than ES2015

- **Fix Type Definition Conflicts**:
  - Resolve conflicts between handlebars type definitions
  - Create unified interfaces for core concepts (ParsedContent, ContentNode, etc.)

### 2. Debug Test Execution Issues

- **NavigationGenerator Tests**:

  - Add detailed logging to trace execution flow
  - Identify potential infinite loops or unresolved promises
  - Fix mocking implementation for file system operations

- **Improve Test Utilities**:
  - Create better mocks for common dependencies
  - Add helper functions for test setup and teardown
  - Implement proper async test patterns

### 3. Complete Documentation

- **API Documentation**:

  - Fix TypeDoc configuration to generate proper documentation
  - Document all public APIs and interfaces
  - Add examples for common use cases

- **Developer Documentation**:
  - Create a comprehensive developer guide
  - Document the architecture and design decisions
  - Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### 1. Enhance Core Features

- **Content Caching**:

  - Implement a caching system for parsed content
  - Add cache invalidation strategies
  - Measure and optimize performance

- **Incremental Generation**:

  - Add support for only rebuilding changed files
  - Implement dependency tracking between files
  - Create a watch mode for development

- **Plugin System Improvements**:
  - Enhance the plugin API for better extensibility
  - Add more built-in plugins for common use cases
  - Create a plugin discovery mechanism

### 2. Improve Test Coverage

- **Increase Test Coverage**:

  - Add tests for untested components
  - Improve existing tests with more edge cases
  - Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows

- **Test Infrastructure**:
  - Set up continuous integration for automated testing
  - Add code coverage reporting
  - Implement snapshot testing for templates

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Profiling and Benchmarking**:

  - Create benchmarks for key operations
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - Implement performance monitoring

- **Optimization Strategies**:
  - Optimize parsing and rendering operations
  - Implement parallel processing where applicable
  - Reduce memory usage for large sites

## Long-Term Vision (3-6 Months)

### 1. Architecture Improvements

- **Microservices Architecture**:

  - Split the monolithic application into services
  - Implement a message queue for communication
  - Create a service discovery mechanism

- **API-First Approach**:
  - Create a well-defined API for all operations
  - Implement a REST API for remote control
  - Add GraphQL support for flexible queries

### 2. User Experience Enhancements

- **Website Personalization**:

  - Add support for user profiles and preferences
  - Implement content recommendations
  - Create a personalized navigation experience

- **Enhanced Navigation**:
  - Improve the navigation generation algorithm
  - Add support for custom navigation structures
  - Implement search and filtering capabilities

### 3. Deployment and Distribution

- **Containerization**:

  - Create Docker images for easy deployment
  - Implement Kubernetes configurations
  - Add support for cloud deployment

- **Distribution Improvements**:
  - Optimize the npm package
  - Create pre-built binaries for major platforms
  - Implement a plugin marketplace

## Implementation Plan

For each of these initiatives, the following approach is recommended:

1. **Research & Planning**:

   - Investigate existing solutions and best practices
   - Create a detailed design document
   - Define success criteria and metrics

2. **Implementation**:

   - Start with a minimal viable implementation
   - Add tests for all new functionality
   - Document the implementation details

3. **Review & Refinement**:

   - Conduct code reviews
   - Gather feedback from users
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Documentation & Release**:
   - Update documentation
   - Create release notes
   - Communicate changes to users

By following this structured approach, we can ensure that the project continues to improve in a sustainable and manageable way.
