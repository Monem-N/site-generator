# Site Generator Master Plan

## Overview

This master plan outlines the strategy for improving and extending the Site Generator project. It serves as a central reference point for all development activities and provides a roadmap for future work.

## Project Vision

The Site Generator project aims to be a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for converting documentation into beautiful websites. It should support a wide range of documentation formats, provide extensive customization options, and generate high-performance websites.

## Current Status

The project has recently undergone TypeScript fixes to resolve compilation errors. While the project now builds successfully, there are still issues with the test suite and opportunities for further improvement in the TypeScript implementation.

For a detailed assessment of the current status, see the [Project Status Report](documentation/project-status.md).

## Development Roadmap

The development roadmap outlines the planned work for the project, organized into short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.

For a detailed roadmap, see the [Development Roadmap](documentation/development-roadmap.md).

### Key Milestones

1. **Test Suite Fixes** (2 weeks)

   - Fix all failing tests
   - Improve test coverage to at least 50%

2. **TypeScript Improvements** (1 month)

   - Reduce type assertions
   - Improve interface definitions
   - Enable stricter TypeScript configuration

3. **Architecture Refactoring** (3 months)

   - Implement microservices architecture
   - Improve error handling
   - Optimize performance

4. **Feature Expansion** (6 months)
   - Add website personalization
   - Enhance navigation
   - Improve branding customization

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Error Handling Standardization**
2. **TypeScript Conversion**
3. **Content Caching**
4. **Generator Testing**
5. **Microservices Architecture**
6. **Incremental Generation**

## Technical Improvements

### Test Improvements

The test suite needs significant improvements to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

For detailed recommendations, see the [Test Improvements](documentation/test-improvements.md) document.

### TypeScript Improvements

The TypeScript implementation can be further improved to enhance type safety and code quality.

For detailed recommendations, see the [TypeScript Improvements](documentation/typescript-improvements.md) document.

## Project Management

### Development Process

1. **Planning**

   - Define clear requirements for each feature
   - Break down work into manageable tasks
   - Prioritize tasks based on impact and dependencies

2. **Implementation**

   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Write tests before or alongside code
   - Document code as it's written

3. **Review**

   - Conduct code reviews for all changes
   - Verify test coverage
   - Check for TypeScript errors

4. **Deployment**
   - Run comprehensive tests before deployment
   - Use semantic versioning
   - Maintain a detailed changelog

### Quality Assurance

1. **Testing Strategy**

   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

2. **Code Quality Metrics**

   - Test coverage (aim for >70%)
   - TypeScript strict compliance
   - Code complexity

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Generation time
   - Memory usage
   - Website load time

## Resource Allocation

### Development Resources

- **Core Development**: Focus on fixing test issues and improving TypeScript implementation
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of code and features
- **Testing**: Dedicate resources to improving test coverage and quality

### Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus                    | Resources      |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| 1     | 2 weeks  | Test fixes               | 1 developer    |
| 2     | 1 month  | TypeScript improvements  | 1-2 developers |
| 3     | 3 months | Architecture refactoring | 2-3 developers |
| 4     | 6 months | Feature expansion        | 3-4 developers |

## Conclusion

This master plan provides a comprehensive strategy for improving and extending the Site Generator project. By following this plan, we can create a more robust, maintainable, and feature-rich tool for converting documentation into websites.

Regular reviews of this plan will ensure that development efforts remain aligned with project goals and user needs. Updates to the plan should be made as new information becomes available or as project priorities change.
