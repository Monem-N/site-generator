# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development activities for the Site Generator project following the TypeScript fixes.

## Short-Term Goals (1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Fix Remaining Test Issues

- **Create Missing Component Generator Module**

  - Implement the component-generator module that's referenced in tests
  - Ensure it follows the expected interface

- **Fix Mock Issues in Tests**

  - Update the fs mocks in DocsifyWebsiteGenerator.test.ts
  - Use proper type assertions for jest.Mock

- **Update Test Data**
  - Add the 'type' property to ContentNode objects in test data
  - Update test expectations to match the new interfaces

### 2. Improve Test Coverage

- **Add Unit Tests for Critical Components**

  - Focus on components with complex logic
  - Ensure all edge cases are covered

- **Add Integration Tests**

  - Test the interaction between different components
  - Verify the end-to-end functionality

- **Set Up Continuous Integration**
  - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request
  - Add code coverage reporting

## Medium-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

### 1. Refactor Codebase

- **Improve Type Safety**

  - Replace any type assertions with proper type definitions
  - Add more explicit type annotations

- **Update Interfaces**

  - Refine interfaces to better reflect the actual structure of objects
  - Add documentation comments to interfaces

- **Implement Design Patterns**
  - Apply appropriate design patterns to improve code organization
  - Reduce code duplication

### 2. Enhance Features

- **Improve Error Handling**

  - Implement a consistent error handling strategy
  - Add detailed error messages and logging

- **Add Content Caching**

  - Implement efficient caching mechanisms
  - Reduce processing time for unchanged content

- **Support Incremental Generation**
  - Only regenerate content that has changed
  - Track dependencies between content files

## Long-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### 1. Architecture Improvements

- **Microservices Architecture**

  - Split the application into smaller, independent services
  - Improve scalability and maintainability

- **API-First Approach**

  - Define clear APIs between components
  - Enable third-party integrations

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
  - Implement parallel processing where appropriate

### 2. Feature Expansion

- **Website Personalization**

  - Add support for user-specific content
  - Implement role-based access control

- **Enhanced Navigation**

  - Improve navigation generation
  - Add support for custom navigation structures

- **Branding Customization**
  - Allow more extensive theme customization
  - Support custom CSS and JavaScript

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Error Handling Standardization**

   - Implement consistent error handling across the codebase
   - Add proper error recovery mechanisms

2. **TypeScript Conversion**

   - Continue improving TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Remove any remaining 'any' types

3. **Content Caching**

   - Implement efficient caching for parsed content
   - Add cache invalidation strategies

4. **Generator Testing**

   - Improve test coverage for the generator components
   - Add performance tests

5. **Microservices Architecture**

   - Design the microservices architecture
   - Implement service boundaries

6. **Incremental Generation**
   - Track content dependencies
   - Only regenerate affected content

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**

  - Track generation time
  - Monitor memory usage

- **Code Quality Metrics**

  - Track test coverage
  - Monitor TypeScript strict compliance

- **User Feedback**
  - Collect feedback from users
  - Prioritize features based on user needs

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to improving the Site Generator project. By addressing the immediate issues with tests and TypeScript, then moving on to more substantial refactoring and feature enhancements, we can create a more robust and maintainable codebase.

Regular reviews of this roadmap will ensure that development efforts remain aligned with project goals and user needs.
